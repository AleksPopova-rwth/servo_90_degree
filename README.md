# servo_90_degree

## Overview

The `servo_90_degree` project demonstrates controlling a servo motor to rotate to a precise 90-degree angle. It uses C programming and a microcontroller to send control signals to the servo, providing a simple example for servo motor manipulation.

## Features

- Servo motor control to 90 degrees
- Uses a basic C implementation
- Can be easily modified for other angles or projects

## Setup

Clone the repository, build, and run the project to control the servo motor.
